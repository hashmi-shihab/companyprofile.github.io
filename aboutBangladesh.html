      <div class="collapsible-body">
      	<span><p><h5>Ancient and classical Bengal</h5>Buddha and Bodhisattvas, 11th century, Pala Empire.Stone Age tools dating back to over 20,000 years ago have been found in the Greater Bengal region thus indicating human settlement in the region.Ancient Bengal was initially occupied by the Austroasiatics, Tibeto-Burmans, Dravidians, and Indo-Aryans in successive waves of migration and main urban settlements were established during the Iron Age towards the middle of the first BCE millennium when the Northern Black Polished Ware culture was established in the Indian sub-continent.</p><p>Bengal was governed by the Mauryan Empire in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BCE. With their citadels in the Bihar and Bengal territories, the Mauryans established the first geographically widespread Iron Age empire in ancient India. The empire promoted Buddhism and Jainism and it was able to reach its apex under emperor Ashoka. The Gupta Empire finally succeeded the Mauryan Empire in the 3rd century. This empire was believed to have originated from the Varendra area in Bangladesh, and it corresponds to present-day Rangpur and Rajshahi divisions. This era brought about the theory of the Earth orbiting the Sun, invention of chess, the study of the lunar and solar eclipses, the concept of zero, and the thriving of drama and Sanskrit literature.In classical antiquity, Bengal was partitioned between different kingdoms.</p><p>The Pala Empire was seen as the biggest Bengali nation developed in ancient history. The empire covered the majority of the north Indian sub-continent during its peak in the 9th century. The Palas were Mahayana Buddhists, and they h2ly supported education, architecture, and art, thus leading to the establishment of the Pala School of Painting and Sculptural Art, the universities of Vikramshila and Nalanda, and the Somapura Mahavihara. The proto-Bengali dialect materialized under Pala rule. The Hindu Sena dynasty, however, took power in the 11th century and it h2ly promoted Brahmanical Hinduism and laid the basis of Bengali Hinduism. The Senas also supported their school of Hindu Art after being inspired by their predecessors. They also merged the caste system in Bengal.Bengal was also an intersection of the Southwestern Silk Road.</p></span>
		<span><p><h5>Islamic Bengal</h5>In 1905 Lord Curzon created the Partition of Bengal.Merchants from the Middle East, Sufis, and missionaries brought with them Islam on the shores of Bengal towards the end of the first millennium. It has been suggested by some experts that early Muslims, including Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas, uncle to Prophet Muhammad, used Bengal as a passage point to travel to China on the Southern Silk Road. The excavation of the Abbasid Caliphate coins in the country portrayed a sturdy trade system during the era of the House of Wisdom in Baghdad, when Arab scientists assimilated pre-Islamic Greek and Indian discoveries. This eventually led to the Indo-Arabic numerals system.</p><p>successive Muslim occupation assimilated the achievements and culture of pre-Islamic civilization in Bengal in the new Islamic polity. The Muslims were able to adopt traditions and customs including food, dress, and way of life, such as wearing bangles, bindu and saris by the Muslim women; and art forms in theater, dance, and music. Conversion to Islam was reinforced in the country via the construction of madrasas, mosques, and Sufi Khanqahs.</p><p>By the 14th century, a sovereign Bengal Sultanate was formed and it was known for its cultural pluralism. The Sultanate, however, started to fall apart by the 16th century and by 1532, Bengal was overran by the Sur Empire who constructed the Grand Trunk Road. Baro-Bhuyan zamindars and Hindu rajas acquired control on huge sections of the territory, particularly in the fertile Bhati area.</p>Towards the end of the 16th century, the Mughal Empire conquered the Bengal delta after the Battle of Tukaroi and Dhaka was formed as Mughal's provincial capital in 1608. Mughal rule brought about agrarian reforms, economic prosperity, and thriving external trade especially in silk textiles and muslin. The agrarian reforms transformed Bengal into the rice basket of the Indian sub-continent.</p><p>In 1717, the Nawabs of Bengal created a sovereign principality and their headquarters were in Murshidabad. The last sovereign Nawab was, however, defeated on 23 June 1757 at the Battle of Plassey by the British.</p><p><h5>British Bengal</h5>The rule of the British East India Company began in 1757 and the Bengal Presidency was formed in 1765 with its capital in Calcutta. During British tenure, East Bengal established a plantation economy that was centered on tea production and jute trade and its share in the supply of jute rose in the early 20th century. In 1905, British divided Bengal and established the administrative division of Eastern Bengal and Assam. This partitioning led to the Swadeshi movement led by the Indian National Congress and in 1911 the division was annulled.</p><p>By the 1930s, the Krishak Praja Party and the Swaraj Party came to represent Bengali's new middle class. The Krishak Praja Party became allies with the Muslim League in 1940 to present the Lahore Resolution which visualized sovereign nations in the northwestern and eastern sub-continent.</p><p>In 1943, the Muslim League established a parliamentary government in the country and in 1946, the victory of the Bengal Muslim League at the Indian provincial elections set the course for the division of British India and the formation of the Dominion of Pakistan on 14 August 1947.</p><p>The period between 1947 and 1970 was characterized by a lot of friction between East Bengal and the Dominion of Pakistan.</p><p><h5>Bangladesh War of independence</h5>On 23 March 1971, the Bangladeshi flag was raised for the first time. Operation Searchlight was, however, launched on 26 March 1971 by the Pakistani military junta who massacred Bengali politicians, students, intellectuals, military defectors, and civil servants during the 1971 Bangladesh genocide.</p><p>During the liberation war, Bengali locals proclaimed a declaration of independence and created the Mukti Bahini, the Bangladeshi National Liberation Army. During the war, the army held Bengali's countryside and waged guerilla operations against the Pakistani forces. India offered support to the army during the war. The United States and the Soviet Union also sent naval forces to the Bengal Bay to offer support. The war lasted for nine months and it came to an end when the Pakistani military surrendered to the Bangladesh-India Allied Forces on 16th December 1971.</p><p>After gaining its independence, Bangladesh became a republic within the Commonwealth and a secular democracy. in 1973, Bangladesh joined the OIC and the Non-Aligned Movement, and later joined the United Nations in 1974.</p>

      <div class="collapsible-body"><span><p>Bangladesh claims some of the most renowned singers, composers and producers in South Asia. Bangladeshi music spans a wide variety of styles. Music has served the purpose of documenting the lives of the people and was widely patronized by the rulers. It comprises a long tradition of religious and regular song writing over a period of almost a millennium.</p><p><h5>Classical music</h5><b>Rabindra Sangeet(Music of Robindra)</b><br><br>Rabindra Sangeet, also known as Tagore Songs, are songs written and composed by Rabindranath Tagore. They have distinctive characteristics in the music of Bengal, popular in India and Bangladesh.<br>To know more about Rabindra Sangeet, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabindra_Sangeet">visit.</a></p><p><b>Nazrul Sangeet(Music of Nazrul)</b><br><br>Nazrul Geeti or Nazrul Sangeet, literally "music of Nazrul," are songs written and composed by Kazi Nazrul Islam, a Bengali poet and national poet of Bangladesh and active revolutionary during the Indian Independence Movement. Nazrul Sangeet incorporate revolutionary notions as well as more spiritual, philosophical and romantic themes.<br>To know more about Nazrul Sangeet, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazrul_Geeti">visit.</a></p><p><h5>Folk Music</h5>Folk has come to occupy the lives of Bangladeshis almost more than any other genre of Bengali music. Among the luminaries of the different folk traditions are Lalon Fokir, Radharaman Dutta, Hason Raja, Khursheed Nurali (Sheerazi), Ramesh Shil, Kari Amir Uddin Ahmed and Abbas Uddin. Folk songs are characterised by simple musical structure and words. Before the advent of radio, entertainment in the rural areas relied on a large extent on stage performances by folk singers. With the arrival of new communication technologies and digital media, many folk songs were modernised and incorporated into modern songs. We have Baul, Bhandari, Bhatiali, Bhawaiya, Dhamail, Gazir Gaan, Gombhira, Hason Raja, Jari, Jatra Pala, Jhumur, Kavigan, Lalon, Pala Gaan, Sari Gaan, Shyama Sangeet and many more flok songs.</p><p>Among all Lalon song is most populer not only in Bangladesh also in many part of world. Infact many foreign people come to Bangladesh just for the purpose of research on lalon music.

Although, to outsiders, this may seems like an ambiguous nomenclature, it has particular motivations. Bengali music traditionally has been classified mainly by the region of origin and the creators of the musical genre, such as Nazrul geeti (written and composed by Kazi Nazrul Islam), ghombhira (unique to a specific area in Bangladesh), etc. However, this prevented the ability to classify any music that failed to fit into any of the classes. In the period just before Indian independence, several new minor musical genres emerged, mainly in the form of playback songs for movies. A miscellaneous category, Adhunik sangeet, was created, since, at that time, this music was "modern".<br>For the list of Bangladeshi modern music collection, <a href="http://webmusic.live/music/mobile/bengali/adhunik.php">visit</a></p><p><h5>Bangladeshi Rock Music</h5>Bangladeshi rock was introduced in 1972 by singer, songwriter, music composer Nasir Ahmed Apu of Spondan band, pioneer of Bengali pop or rock and re-invented Bengali folk music in Bangladesh. Present time most populer bands are Souls, Miles, Nagar Baul, Warfaze, RockStrata, LRB, Ark, Blue Birds etc. To Know more about Bangladeshi pop or rock music, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladeshi_rock">visit</a></p></div>

You need a permit from the Divisional Forest Office in Khulna. With permit in hand, it's possible to hire a boat from Mongla or Dhangmari to get you to Hiron Point.
